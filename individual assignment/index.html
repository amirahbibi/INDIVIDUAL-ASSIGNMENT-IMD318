	    <h1>All <br><span>About</span> <br>Mira</h1>
		<p class="par">I’m a dedicated student currently pursuing my education with a passion for learning and growth. I strive to balance my academic responsibilities while staying curious about the world around me.  
As a daughter, I’m deeply grateful for my family’s support and do my best to make them proud by working hard and contributing positively to our home. Being the only sister in my family, I take pride in my role as a loving and supportive sibling. I enjoy bonding with my family, whether it’s helping my siblings, sharing advice, or just spending quality time together.  
In my free time, I love exploring new hobbies, helping out at home, and building memories with the people who matter most.</p>
