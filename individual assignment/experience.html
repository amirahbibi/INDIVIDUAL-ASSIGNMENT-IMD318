	<h2>Internship Experience</h2>
	<p>During my two-month internship at the Pahang State Archive, I gained invaluable experience in archiving and preservation, including cataloging and organizing historical documents, assisting with digitization projects, and supporting researchers in accessing records. I was introduced to archive management systems, learned about legal and ethical practices, and contributed to ongoing projects and exhibitions. The internship enhanced my problem-solving skills as I handled fragile materials and incomplete records while collaborating with archivists and historians. This experience deepened my understanding of the critical role archives play in preserving history and cultural heritage.</p>   </p>
